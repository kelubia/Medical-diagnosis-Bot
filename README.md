# Medical-diagnosis-Bot
# 🩺 My Medical Bot – A Python Adventure

Welcome to my little coding experiment in **problem-solving with Python**!  
Here’s the idea: what if I could write a program that feels like a friendly **medical assistant**, asking questions and guiding someone through checking if they might be dehydrated?  

It’s not a doctor (seriously, don’t use it for actual medical decisions 🛑), but it’s a fun way to practice algorithms, project management, and interactive programming.

## 🌱 Why I Built This
I believe programming shines brightest when it tackles **real-world problems**.  
Medicine is one of those fields where the digital revolution changed everything, so I thought: *why not start here?*  

This project let me:
- Flex my Python skills 💻  
- Explore how algorithms feel when applied to real human questions 🤔  
- Learn how even simple bots can spark big conversations about data and society 🌍  

---

## 🚀 What It Does
- Walks the user through a **questionnaire** about dehydration  
- Uses **decision-making logic** (tiny algorithm party 🎉) to process answers  
- Shows how a text-based bot can actually feel interactive  
- Keeps the code modular, readable, and expandable  

---

## 🧰 Skills I Practiced
- Organizing and **managing coding projects**  
- **Designing and testing algorithms** (and fixing my mistakes along the way 👀)  
- Building **decision-based questionnaires** that don’t feel boring  
- Handling user input/output cleanly  
- Thinking about the **societal impacts** of using programming in healthcare

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3** (my trusty sidekick 🐍)  
- Built in **Replit**, but runs anywhere with Python  
- Plain text interface (keeping it old-school 💾)
